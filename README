This program manages the patients in and out of an emergency room.
Patients are placed in the waiting list based on priority given at time
of entry.  Priority can be changed at any time for any patient.  Add patients to empty exam rooms with the 'fill exam rooms' button.  Pediatric rooms
are prefixed with 'P'.  General purpose rooms are prefixed with '1' (one).  If
the only empty room is a pediatric room, the program will skip adult patients
and find the next available pediatric patient in the list.  If the only empty 
room is a general purpose room, the next person in the list will be admitted.
